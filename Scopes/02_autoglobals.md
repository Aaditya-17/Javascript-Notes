In JavaScript, the term **autoglobals** isn't an official concept, but it can sometimes refer to **global variables** or **variables that are automatically accessible globally without explicit declaration**. Here's a more detailed explanation:

---

### Implicit Global Variables (Autoglobals)

These are variables that become global automatically when assigned a value **without using `var`, `let`, or `const`** in non-strict mode.

#### Example:

```javascript
function test() {
    autoGlobal = "I'm automatically global!";
}

test();

console.log(autoGlobal); // Outputs: "I'm automatically global!"
```

In this example:

-   `autoGlobal` is declared inside the function but without `var`, `let`, or `const`. This causes it to be implicitly attached to the global object (`window` in browsers or `global` in Node.js).

### Issues with Implicit Globals

1. **Pollution of the Global Scope**:

    - Implicit globals can lead to unintended overwriting of variables, causing bugs in the code.

2. **Harder Debugging**:

    - It's challenging to track down where an implicit global was introduced, leading to potential errors.

3. **Strict Mode**:
    - In strict mode (`"use strict";`), assigning a value to an undeclared variable throws a `ReferenceError`.

#### Example with Strict Mode:

```javascript
"use strict";

function test() {
    autoGlobal = "This will throw an error!"; // ReferenceError
}

test();
```

### Safer Practices

To avoid the risks of autoglobals:

-   Always declare variables explicitly using `let`, `const`, or `var`.
-   Use `"use strict";` to enforce better coding practices.

#### Example:

```javascript
function test() {
    let localVar = "I'm local!";
    console.log(localVar);
}

test();
console.log(localVar); // Error: localVar is not defined
```

### Global Objects in JavaScript

In JavaScript, the **global object** provides a set of automatically accessible variables and functions (sometimes referred to as "autoglobals"):

1. **Browser Environment (`window`)**:

    - `window` is the global object.
    - Example autoglobals:
        - `document`, `console`, `setTimeout`, etc.

2. **Node.js Environment (`global`)**:
    - `global` is the global object.
    - Example autoglobals:
        - `process`, `require`, `setTimeout`, etc.

In summary, while "autoglobals" isn't a formal JavaScript term, it typically refers to implicitly created global variables or the automatically accessible global objects and their properties. Avoid implicit globals to write more robust and maintainable code.
