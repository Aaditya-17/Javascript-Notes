## Closures

In JavaScript, **closures** are a powerful feature where a function retains access to its **lexical scope** (the scope in which it was defined) even after that scope has exited. This allows the function to "remember" and continue to access variables from its outer scope, even when executed in a different context.

### How Closures Work:

A closure is created when:

1. A function is defined inside another function (a nested function).
2. The inner function "remembers" variables from its outer function, even after the outer function has returned.

### Example of a Closure:

#### Code:

```javascript
function process() {
    let i = 0; // Outer variable
    let arr = [0, 1, 2]; // Outer variable
    let k = 10; // Outer variable, but not accessed by any inner function

    // First inner function
    function inner() {
        i += 1; // Modifies `i` from the outer scope
        arr.push(i); // Modifies `arr` from the outer scope
        console.log(arr); // Logs `arr`
        return i; // Returns the updated value of `i`
    }

    // Second inner function
    function inner2() {
        i += 2; // Modifies `i` from the outer scope
        return i; // Returns the updated value of `i`
    }

    // Returning both inner functions as methods in an object
    return { inner, inner2 };
}

// Create closure by calling `process`
let res1 = process();

// Calling `inner` function via the closure
console.log(res1.inner()); // During execution, the `inner` function remembers `i` and `arr`
// Calling `inner2` function via the closure
console.log(res1.inner2()); // During execution, the `inner2` function remembers `i`
```

#### Key Observations:

1. **Outer Variables:**

    - `i`, `arr`, and `k` are defined in the outer function `process`.
    - Both `inner` and `inner2` functions have access to `i` and `arr` because they use them.
    - `k` is **not accessed** by either `inner` or `inner2`, so it's not part of their closure.

2. **What Does `res1` Hold?**

    - When you call `process()`, it returns an object with references to the `inner` and `inner2` functions.
    - These functions "remember" their lexical environment (variables from `process` that they use).

3. **Execution Flow:**

    - **First Call: `res1.inner()`**

        - `i` starts at `0`, gets incremented to `1`.
        - `arr` starts as `[0, 1, 2]` and has `1` pushed into it, so it becomes `[0, 1, 2, 1]`.
        - Logs `[0, 1, 2, 1]` and returns `1`.

    - **Second Call: `res1.inner2()`**
        - `i` is now `1` (updated by the previous call to `inner`).
        - `i` is incremented by `2`, so it becomes `3`.
        - Returns `3`.

4. **Scope Remembered by Each Function:**
    - The `inner` function remembers and modifies `i` and `arr`. It does not know or use `k`.
    - The `inner2` function remembers and modifies `i`. It also does not know or use `k`.

### Final Output:

```javascript
let res1 = process();
console.log(res1.inner()); // Logs: [0, 1, 2, 1], Returns: 1
console.log(res1.inner2()); // Returns: 3
```

#### Why is This a Closure?

-   The `inner` and `inner2` functions are closures because they **retain access** to variables (`i` and `arr`) from their outer lexical scope (`process`) even after `process` has finished executing.
-   This is why `inner` and `inner2` can both access and update `i` persistently across calls.

Closures enable **stateful behavior** in functions and are crucial for maintaining data encapsulation.

### Uses of Closures:

1. **Data Hiding:** Create private variables and methods.
2. **Callback Functions:** Common in asynchronous programming (e.g., event handlers, `setTimeout`).
3. **Factory Functions:** Generate functions with specific behavior.
4. **Maintaining State:** Track data in situations where state is required (e.g., counters, configurations).

Closures are a fundamental concept in JavaScript, often used in functional programming and modern frameworks. Understanding closures helps in writing cleaner, more efficient, and modular code.
