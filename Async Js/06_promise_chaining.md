### Explanation of the Code

This code demonstrates the sequential execution of asynchronous tasks using **Promises** and **chaining**. The three functions—`download`, `saveIntoFile`, and `upload`—represent different tasks, each returning a `Promise`.

### Functions Breakdown:

#### 1. **`download(url)`**

-   **Purpose**: Simulates downloading data from a given URL.
-   **Parameters**:
    -   `url`: The source URL for downloading data.
-   **Logic**:
    -   Returns a `Promise`.
    -   After a delay of 5 seconds (simulated using `setTimeout`), it:
        -   Logs that data is being downloaded.
        -   Resolves with a hardcoded string `"aditya"` as the downloaded data.

#### 2. **`saveIntoFile(data)`**

-   **Purpose**: Simulates saving the downloaded data into a file.
-   **Parameters**:
    -   `data`: The downloaded data to save.
-   **Logic**:
    -   Returns a `Promise`.
    -   After a delay of 5 seconds, it:
        -   Logs the action of saving the data into a file named `"test.txt"`.
        -   Resolves with the file name `"test.txt"`.

#### 3. **`upload(url, fileName)`**

-   **Purpose**: Simulates uploading the file to a new URL.
-   **Parameters**:
    -   `url`: The destination URL for uploading the file.
    -   `fileName`: The name of the file to upload.
-   **Logic**:
    -   Returns a `Promise`.
    -   After a delay of 5 seconds, it:
        -   Logs the action of uploading the file to the URL.
        -   Resolves with the file name.

### Execution Flow and Internal Working

#### **Step 1**: Call `download("abc.com")`

-   A new `Promise` is created.
-   After 5 seconds:
    -   Logs: `"Data downloading from abc.com"`.
    -   Resolves with the string `"aditya"` (downloaded data).
-   Moves to the next `then()`.

#### **Step 2**: `saveIntoFile(data)` is called with `data = "aditya"`

-   A new `Promise` is created.
-   After 5 seconds:
    -   Logs: `"aditya  saved in  test.txt"`.
    -   Resolves with `"test.txt"` (file name).
-   Moves to the next `then()`.

#### **Step 3**: `upload("new.com", fileName)` is called with `fileName = "test.txt"`

-   A new `Promise` is created.
-   After 5 seconds:
    -   Logs: `"uploading  test.txt  to  new.com"`.
    -   Resolves with `"test.txt"`.
-   Moves to the next `then()`.

#### **Step 4**: Final `then()` logs the result

-   Logs: `"wE HAVE uploaded in test.txt"`.

### Timeline of Execution

| Time (seconds) | Action                                  | Logs Output                          |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| 0              | Start `download("abc.com")`             |                                      |
| 5              | Resolve `download`, call `saveIntoFile` | `"Data downloading from abc.com"`    |
| 10             | Resolve `saveIntoFile`, call `upload`   | `"aditya  saved in  test.txt"`       |
| 15             | Resolve `upload`, log final message     | `"uploading  test.txt  to  new.com"` |
| 20             | Final log                               | `"wE HAVE uploaded in test.txt"`     |

---

### Complete Execution Flow

1. `download("abc.com")` starts.
2. After 5 seconds, it resolves with `"aditya"`.
3. `saveIntoFile("aditya")` starts.
4. After 5 seconds, it resolves with `"test.txt"`.
5. `upload("new.com", "test.txt")` starts.
6. After 5 seconds, it resolves with `"test.txt"`.
7. The final `then()` logs: `"wE HAVE uploaded in test.txt"`.
