In JavaScript, **autoboxing** refers to the automatic conversion of primitive data types (such as `string`, `number`, or `boolean`) into their corresponding **wrapper objects** (like `String`, `Number`, or `Boolean`) when accessing methods or properties on the primitive values.

This happens because primitive types in JavaScript are not objects and do not inherently have methods or properties. To allow the use of methods (like `.toUpperCase()` for strings), JavaScript temporarily "wraps" the primitive in its corresponding object type.

### **How It Works**

1. When you try to access a property or method on a primitive value, JavaScript:

    - Automatically creates a corresponding object wrapper for that primitive.
    - Executes the method or accesses the property.
    - Discards the wrapper object after the operation.

2. The primitive remains unchanged because the wrapper is temporary.

### **Example of Autoboxing**

#### **For Strings:**

```javascript
const str = "hello";
console.log(str.toUpperCase()); // "HELLO"
```

-   `str` is a primitive string (`"hello"`).
-   JavaScript internally converts it to a `String` object to call `.toUpperCase()`.
-   After the method call, the wrapper object is discarded, and `str` remains a primitive.

#### **For Numbers:**

```javascript
const num = 42;
console.log(num.toString()); // "42"
```

-   `num` is a primitive number (`42`).
-   JavaScript temporarily wraps it in a `Number` object to call `.toString()`.

#### **For Booleans:**

```javascript
const bool = true;
console.log(bool.toString()); // "true"
```

-   `bool` is a primitive boolean (`true`).
-   JavaScript autoboxes it into a `Boolean` object to call `.toString()`.

### **Wrapper Objects in JavaScript**

The primitive types and their corresponding wrapper objects are:

| Primitive Type | Wrapper Object |
| -------------- | -------------- |
| `string`       | `String`       |
| `number`       | `Number`       |
| `boolean`      | `Boolean`      |
| `symbol`       | `Symbol`       |
| `bigint`       | `BigInt`       |

### **Manual Boxing (Not Recommended)**

You can manually create wrapper objects, but this is rarely needed and can lead to unexpected behavior:

```javascript
const strObj = new String("hello"); // Explicitly creating a String object
console.log(typeof strObj); // "object"

const primitiveStr = "hello";
console.log(typeof primitiveStr); // "string"
```

---

### **Key Points to Remember**

1. Autoboxing is **temporary**; it only exists for the duration of the operation.
2. Wrapper objects are different from their primitive counterparts:
    ```javascript
    console.log("hello" === new String("hello")); // false
    ```
    - A primitive and its wrapper object are not the same.
3. Prefer using primitives instead of explicitly creating wrapper objects to avoid confusion.
